# IdeaEngine

I'm still figuring out how GitHub works for creating a new project.

The current code was quickly created as a proof of concept for a hackathon and will need to be refactored and improved.

This project depends on StereoKit.

The music in the demo is licensed to me but cannot be be freely distributed as open source, so I will replace the wave files with empty sound files.
